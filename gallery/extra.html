        <p class="para1"><b>Wedding photography</b> is a specialty in <i> photography</i> that is primarily focused on the photography of events 
            and activities relating to weddings. It may include other types of portrait photography of the couple 
            before the official wedding day, such as a pre-wedding engagement session 
            (photographs are later used for the couple wedding invitations). 
            On the official wedding day, the photographer(s) will attempt to provide portrait photography, 
            as well as documentary photography coverage to document the different wedding events and rituals throughout the wedding day(s).<br><br>
        Indian weddings are significantly different from western marriages. While western marriage rituals have become common in many countries, 
        they have not become common in India except among the Christian population.
    <br><br>
    Wedding photography is now a major commercial endeavor in India that supports the bulk of the efforts for many photographers. 
    There are photographers outside of India that specialize in Indian weddings.</p></div>

        <h3 class="heading2"> About Wild Photography</h3>
        <p class="para2"> <b>Wildlife photography</b> is a genre of photography concerned with documenting various forms of wildlife in their natural habitat.
            As well as requiring photography skills, wildlife photographers may need field craft skills. 
            For example, some animals and birds are difficult to approach and thus a knowledge of the animal's and birds behavior is needed in order to be able to predict its actions. 
            Photographing some species may require stalking skills or the use of a hide/blind for concealment.<br><br>

            Wildlife photography can also be valuable for conservation purposes. By sharing your <i>wildlife photos</i>, you can portray the beauty of nature. 
            And you can convey messages about the importance of maintaining habitats for your favorite creatures.<br><br>
            This is the biggest challenge that wildlife photographers face. 
            Therefore, getting close is the number one concern of the wildlife photographer; it involves several key considerations, including getting close physically (by stalking, using a blind, etc.) 
            and getting close optically (with a camera/lens combination).

             <!-- creating paragraph class name is para3 -->
            <p class="para3">
                <b>Creative photography</b> is a technique by which you combine different shapes, colors, and forms of ordinary moments and turn them into creative arts using your photography skills. 
                This type of photography demands a unique way of seeing things and projecting an innovative image, altered from reality. <br> <br>
                In creative photography, you intentionally use an element to enhance the uniqueness of your image. The aspect could result from a simple workflow you followed to get that unique image or a complex post-processing technique that enriches your imageâ€™s mood and texture. For instance, more than getting a perfect exposure in the camera, you need to think of ways by which you can introduce a perspective into the image. 
                This makes it look creative and differentiates it from <i>traditional photography</i>. <br> <br>
                It involves adopting a new, different approach toward a photo, without which it would be seen as a common picture.
                If a picture has intentionally been treated in a way that gives it a deeper meaning, then it can be categorized as a creative photograph!

        <h3 class="heading4">About Time Lapse Photography</h3>
         <!-- creating paragraph class name is para3 -->
        <p class="para4">
            <b>Time-lapse photography</b> is used to capture change or movement that occurs over a long period time. In order to capture how a plant grows or a glacier moves, a photographer sets up a camera in a fixed location and takes a single picture at regular time intervals. 
            When the individual photos are played back in rapid sequential order, viewers are able to see growth or movement of the object or process that was photographed.
        <br> <br>
        Time-lapse photography is a technique in which the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than the frequency used to view the sequence. When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured at 1 frame per second but then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase. 
        which slows down an otherwise <i>fast action, as in slow motion or high-speed photography</i>. <br> <br>
