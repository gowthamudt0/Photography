    <p id="first">A macro lens is a dedicated camera lens that is optically optimized to handle extremely close focusing distances. It can take sharp, highly detailed images of microscopic subjects. It typically has a magnification ratio of 1:1 and a minimum focusing distance of around 12 inches (30 centimeters) or less.

        Unlike other lenses, macros are capable of high reproduction ratios. This means that the ratio of the subject size on the sensor plane is similar or greater than the actual size of the subject in real life.<br><br>

        <h2>Uses of Macro Lens</h2>
        <p> 
            Obviously, macro lenses are used for shooting close-ups. But what does a macro lens do apart from taking tack-sharp images of tiny subjects?

Many believe that macros aren’t all that versatile, but that’s really not the case. First off, it’s a great lens for newborn photography. It’s especially great when photographing tiny details like the baby’s eyelashes, fingers, or toes. It’s also a great lens for product photography, especially if you’re dealing with smaller products.

Your macro lens can also act as a portrait lens. It actually works well for portraiture because it captures amazing detail. It also allows you to achieve correct focus even when you stand very close to the subject. Plus, the macro lens comes in focal lengths that are also ideal for portraits.  </p></section>

            <h2>Best Focal Length For a Macro Lens</h2>
            <p>Macro lenses also have a wide range of focal lengths. But since macro photography works with extremely close focusing distances, the best lenses are typically long-barreled and are usually no shorter than 40 to 60mm.Macro focal lengths and their different uses:
                45 to 65mm: best macro lens focal length for product photography, shooting small subjects that you can get very close to without scaring it away, and capturing scenes that require a natural background perspective
                90 to 105mm: best macro lens focal length for shooting insects, small animals, flowers, plants, and other small subjects that you can still shoot from a comfortable distance
                150 to 200mm: best macro lens focal length for shooting insects and other small subjects that require you to be farther away while still maintaining the closest focusing distance
                Variable focal length – best macro lens focal length for multipurpose macro shooting
                Ideally, your macro lens should be a prime—the lens should have a fixed focal length. Macros come in both zoom and prime varieties, but a prime is the better choice if you want 1:1 magnification. In general, macro zooms are not truly macro. Although, they can still offer high magnification ratios and extremely close focusing distances. </p></section>

            <img src="images/macro2-removebg-preview.png" width="350" height="400"> <h2>Retrofocus Lenses</h2>
            <p>
                Inverting the telephoto configuration, employing one or more negative lens groups in front of a positive
lens group, creates a wide-angle lens with an increased back focal distance. These are called retrofocus
lenses or inverted telephotos, which have greater clearance from the rear element to the film plane than their
focal length would permit with a conventional wide-angle lens optical design. This allows for greater
clearance for other optical or mechanical parts such as the mirror parts in a single-lens reflex camera. Zoom
lenses that are telephotos at one extreme of the zoom range and retrofocus at the other are now common.
