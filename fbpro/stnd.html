    <p id="first">A standard lens, also known as a "normal lens", is one which produces an image that roughly matches what the human eye sees, and which looks natural to the viewer. It sits between the telephoto lens and the wide angle lens, which produce unnaturally zoomed-in and zoomed-out images respectively.

        Standard lenses have an angle of view of around 50 to 55 degrees diagonally. This is roughly the same as the angle that the human eye can comfortably view, which is why it gives a natural-looking perspective.
        
        Normal lenses make great general-purpose lenses, and can be used to photograph everything from close-up portraits to landscapes. They tend to be very "fast" lenses (i.e. they have a wide aperture), making them great for indoor and low-light photography.

            A prime lens is a lens with a fixed focal length, typically with a maximum aperture of f/1.2-f/2.8. They're fantastic for filmmakers and photographers who want the best optical quality and prefer a shallower depth of field in their images and footage. Popular prime lens focal lengths are 35mm, 50mm, and 85mm.Prime lenses have a single specified focal length, like 50mm. They come in all kinds sizes and focal lengths, from fisheye to super-telephoto. Examples of prime lenses: Nikon 50 f/1.8G, Canon 800mm f/5.6L IS, Sigma 35mm f/1.4.
            If a lens has a focal length of (or passes through) 50mm, it's a standard lens. (On its own, the human eye sees the equivalent of a 50mm lens.) If a lens has a focal length over 100mm, it's a telephoto lens.
            By definition, normal lenses are "prime" (i.e. they have a fixed focal length). This can deter some photographers, who think that they will be less versatile than zoom lenses. However, they more than make up for the lack of zoom by having superior optical quality and wide apertures.A prime lens is a lens which has a fixed "zoom" or
            focal length. It is easier to make fixed focal lenses thanto include them in a variable focus lens. Therefore,fixed focal lenses usually have a larger opening, known as an aperture, than comparable variable focus
            lenses. They are usually also of a higher optical
