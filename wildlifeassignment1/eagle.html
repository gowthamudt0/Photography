    <h2> Robert Doisneau Photography</h2>
    <p>
       <i>Doisneau's father, a plumber, died on active service in World War I, when his son was about four. His mother died when he was seven. He then was raised by an aunt.[1][3] At thirteen, he enrolled at the École Estienne, a craft school from which he graduated in 1929 with diplomas in engraving and lithography. There he had his first contact with the arts, taking classes in figure drawing and still life.

        When he was 16, he took up amateur photography, but was reportedly so shy that he started by photographing cobble-stones before progressing to children and then adults.[3]
        
        At the end of the 1920s, Doisneau found work as a draughtsman (lettering artist) in the advertising industry at Atelier Ullmann (Ullmann Studio), a creative graphics studio that specialised in the pharmaceutical industry. Here he took an opportunity to change career by also acting as camera assistant in the studio and then becoming a staff photographer.[3][4][5]
        
        Photography in the 1930s
        In 1931, he left both the studio and advertising, taking a job as an assistant with the modernist photographer André Vigneau.[3][4][5] In 1932, he sold his first photographic story to Excelsior magazine.[1]
        
        In 1934, he began working as an industrial advertising photographer for the Renault car factory at Boulogne-Billancourt.[3] Working at Renault increased Doisneau's interest in working with photography and people. Five years later, in 1939, he was dismissed because he was constantly late. He was forced to try freelance advertising, engraving, and postcard photography to earn his living. At that time, the French postcard industry was the largest in Europe, postcards served as greetings cards as well as vacation souvenirs.[6] In 1991, he said that the years at the Renault car factory marked "the beginning of his career as a photographer and the end of his youth."
        
        In 1939, he was later hired by Charles Rado of the Rapho photographic agency and traveled throughout France in search of picture stories. This is where he took his first professional street photographs.
        
        War service and resistance
        Doisneau worked at the Rapho agency until the outbreak of World War II, whereupon he was drafted into the French army as both a soldier and photographer. He was in the army until 1940 and, from then until the end of the war in 1945, used his draughtsmanship, lettering artistry, and engraving skills to forge passports and identification papers for the French Resistance.

        Some of Doisneau's most memorable photographs were taken after the war. He returned to freelance photography and sold photographs to Life and other international magazines. He briefly joined the Alliance Photo Agency but rejoined the Rapho agency in 1946 and remained with them throughout his working life, despite receiving an invitation from Henri Cartier-Bresson to join Magnum Photos.[1][6]
        
        His photographs never ridiculed the subjects; thus he refused to photograph women whose heads had been shaved as punishment for sleeping with Germans.[3]
        
        I don't photograph life as it is, but life as I would like it to be.
        
        — Robert Doisneau[3]
        In 1948, he was contracted by Vogue to work as a fashion </i>
