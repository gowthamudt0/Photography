        Career
        De Keyzer was born on 27 December 1958,[citation needed] in Kortrijk, Belgium.[2] His freelance career began in 1982, at which time he also taught at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts, Ghent, Belgium.[2] During this time, he co-founded the XYZ-Photography Gallery.
        
        Major subjects in his work have included the collapse of Soviet Union and India. Robert Koch gallery describes his work as investigating "marginalized social groups and constructs uncritical psychological portraits which work to familiarize the 'other.'"[3]
        
        He was nominated to the Magnum Photos agency in 1990, became an associated member in 1992 and a full member in 1994. He currently lives in Ghent and continues to teach.
