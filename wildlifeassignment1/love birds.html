       <i> éhahn (born on 4 May 1979 in Bayeux in Normandy, France) is a French photographer based in Hoi An, Vietnam.[1] Known as the photographer that "captures souls",[2] he is recognized for his portraits of Vietnam, Cuba, Malaysia and India, and for his cultural preservation work.

        In 2011, he launched The Precious Heritage Project with the goal of increasing recognition of Vietnam's diverse tribes through stories examples of their craftsmanship, and large scale portraits of each group in their traditional clothing. The project explores the histories as well as the changing futures of the tribes as globalization and development alter their homelands and subsequently their traditions.[3]
        
        On January 1, 2017, Réhahn opened the Precious Heritage Art Gallery Museum with the goal of creating a single place to preserve the artifacts and costumes he'd been given by the chiefs of many tribes as well as to share the portraits, stories and musical traditions of the ethnic groups.[4] The museum is free to the public.
        
        Réhahn completed his primary mission of meeting all 54 officially recognized ethnic groups in September 2019 and continues his research to discover the numerous subgroups that are spread throughout the country.[5]

        Career
        In 2007, the artist travelled to Vietnam for the first time on a humanitarian mission with the French NGO Les Enfants du Vietnam. He explored the country and its culture and captured more than 50,000 photographs. In 2011, after several more trips, he decided to move to Vietnam and settled in the UNESCO heritage town of Hoi An.[6] It was there that he captured "Hidden Smile",  the photograph of Madame Xong, captain of a small tourist riverboat, which has since been published in more than 100 articles worldwide. In 2014, he chose this photograph for the cover of his first book, "Vietnam, Mosaic of Contrasts",[7] a collection of 150 photographs depicting the diversity of the country. A bestseller in Vietnam, the book is now sold in 29 countries.
        
        The photographer's work became known in France when the French travel TV program Échappées Belles (France 5),[8] featured him in a documentary about Vietnam on June 15, 2016.
        
        Following the success of his first book, Réhahn published “Vietnam, Mosaic of Contrasts, Volume II” in 2015 and “Vietnam, Mosaic of Contrasts, Volume III” in 2020. In addition to this series, he released two coffee table size editions - “The Collection, 10 Years of Photography” (2018) and “100 Iconic Portraits” (2019)-  to showcase his photographic work in Cuba, Malaysia, South and Centra America, and the Indian subcontinent in addition to Vietnam.

        First room about North of Vietnam
        In 2013, while travelling to meet the tribes of northern Vietnam, Réhahn witnessed not only the diversity and the rich culture of these groups but also the fragility of their heritage.[9] Traditional costumes, dialects, rites and ancestral knowledge are fading or being replaced by other methods as the country's development increases.[10] Réhahn started to collect traditional costumes generally offered by the chief of the village themselves in order to preserve and present their culture.[11]
        
        On 1 January 2017, he opened the Precious Heritage Art Gallery Museum. Created to foster intellectual curiosity and open the doors to understanding and communication with the diverse ethnicities present in Vietnam, the museum attracts both tourists and locals.[12] Within 500 square meters, this cultural art space showcases more than 200 photographs of members from each group in their traditional dress.[13] Displayed alongside the photographs are more than 65 authentic tribal costumes, some of them were given by the village chief as a means of preservation since many of these garments are no longer being made. Each ethnic group is presented with factual information and the stories of Réhahn's encounter with the tribe. The texts are available in English, French and Vietnamese.[14]
        
        In September 2019, Réhahn completed his primary mission of researching, meeting, and documenting each of the 54 ethnic groups in Vietnam.[15]

       Wildlife photographers use many different types of equipment to aid them in their quest to photograph their various subjects. The type of equipment needed by the photographer depends on what kind of animal he is shooting, what it will be doing, when it will be out, and the type of environment in which it lives. There are many different cameras, films, and other equipment to be used when photographing various subjects. Photographers sometimes use aerial photography and underwater photography to get pictures of some species. Wildlife photographing can be as easy as a walk in the park or as dangerous as swimming with sharks. (Hedgecoe. 1999.).
       The type of camera used to take photographs of wildlife depends on what the photographer is shooting. Most wildlife photographers use a view camera. These cameras produce photographs with greater sharpness and detail than regular cameras. They allow photographers unparalleled control of perspective and focus. Rangefinder cameras are often used also. They allow the photographer to frame their subjects. Most view cameras have rangefinders built into them. .
       Different lenses are also used for different subjects. Wide-angle lenses are used to photograph large animals or groups of animals. A wide-angle lens is also used to photograph an animal in its surroundings.
