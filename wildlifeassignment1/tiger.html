       <i> Steve McCurry is an American photographer, freelancer, and photojournalist.

McCurry has photographed many assignments for National Geographic and has been a member of Magnum Photos since 1986. Wikipedia
        Born: 23 April 1950 (age 72 years), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States
        Nationality: American
        Education: Penn State University
        Awards: World Press Photo Award for Daily Life, MORE
        Nominations: World Press Photo Award for Daily Life, MOREare used to photograph large animals or groups of animals.McCurry concentrates on the toll war takes on humans. He intends to show what war does to not only the landscape, but to the people who inhabit that land. "Most of my images are grounded in people. I look for the unguarded moment, the essential soul peeking out, experience etched on a person face. I try to convey what it is like to be that person, a person caught in a broader landscape, that you could call the human condition."[6] What McCurry wants his viewers to take away from his photographs is the "human connection between all of us." He believes there is always some common thing between all humans despite the differences in religion, language, ethnicity, etc.[4] McCurry also states, "I have found that I get completely consumed by the importance of the story I am telling, the feeling that the world has got to know. It's never about the adrenaline. It's about the story."[3] However, sometimes McCurry has witnessed some "horrific" and "distressing" sights. In times like these, he uses his camera as a "shield" because it's easier to witness these events through a viewfinder.[3]

        On September 10, 2001, McCurry had just gotten back from Tibet. The morning of September 11, McCurry received a call saying the World Trade Center was on fire. He went up to the roof of his building and started taking photographs, unaware that it was a plane that had hit the towers. McCurry was on the roof when both of the towers fell, "they were just gone. It didnt seem possible. Like youre seeing something but you dont really believe what youre seeing."[8] After the fall of the towers, McCurry ran to Ground Zero with his assistant. He describes the scene, "there was this very fine white powder everywhere and all this office paper, but there was no recognizable office equipmentâ€”no filing cabinets, telephones, computers. It seemed like the whole thing had been pulverized." McCurry left later that night and went back early on September 12, he didn't have any press credentials and had to sneak past security. He was eventually caught and escorted off Ground Zero; he did not go back again.[8]
        
        McCurry is portrayed in a TV documentary The Face of the Human Condition (2003) by Denis Delestrac.[9]
        
        McCurry switched from shooting color slide film to digital capture in 2005 for the convenience of editing in the field and transmitting images to photo editors. He said that he had no nostalgia about working in film in an interview with The Guardian. "Perhaps old habits are hard to break, but my experience is that the majority of my colleagues, regardless of age, have switched over ... The quality has never been better. You can work in extremely low light situations, for example."[10] A wide-angle lens is also used to photograph an animal in its surroundings.
